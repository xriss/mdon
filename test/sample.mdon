Anything at the start of the file will be ignored and probably deleted. 
Any text inside a mdon code chunk will be parsed as hjson. If no 
language is specified then mdon is assumed. So if you wish to include 
code chunks make sure give the language.


```mdon
{
  "extra":"data",
  "sub":["one","two","three"]
  "special":
  
```

All of this text will be assigned to the "special" key and the whole 
point of this is that it should be treated as markdown.

```json
{
  "more":""
}
```

The code chunk type above is neither mdon or null so will be included 
as raw markdown in the special string. In case you need to escape a 
code chunk.


	indented:
	

Code chunks can just be indented.


```
  "more": stuff
}
```

The last non white space char of the code chunk must be a : for the 
next chunk of text to be assigned to it. So this text is ignored.
