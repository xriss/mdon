Anything at the start of the file will be ignored and probably deleted. 
Any text inside a mdon code chunk will be parsed as hjson. If no 
language is specified then mdon is assumed. So if you wish to include 
code chunks make sure give the language.


```mdon
{
  "extra":"data",
  "special":
```

All of this text will be assigned to the "special" key and the whole 
point of this is that it should be treated as markdown.

```
  "extra": stuff
}
```

Extra text at the end of the file will be ignored. The last non 
white space char of the code chunk mist be a : for the next chunk of 
text to be assigned to it otherwise mdon code chunks are just merged.
